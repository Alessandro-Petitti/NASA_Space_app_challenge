# Moonquake Visualizer

Welcome to the Moonquake Visualizer repository! In response to the challenge posed, we have developed an application that plots seismic events detected by the EASEP and ALSEP instruments on an interactive 3-D digital moon globe. Our solution allows you to explore seismic data in a visually engaging and interactive manner.

## Features

- **3-D Digital Moon Globe**: Explore the moon's surface and view seismic events as interactive elements.

- **Interactive Visualization**: Seismic events are represented as pins, concentric torus shapes, or circles, making it easy to understand their impact.

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easily navigate the lunar globe, select specific events, and access relevant information.

- **Customizable Settings**: Adjust the level of detail and choose between different visualization options.

- **Moonquake Simulator**: The repository includes code for an Arduino-based moonquake simulator that complements the digital experience.

## Getting Started

You can experience the Moonquake Visualizer by following these simple steps:

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

2. Open the `index.html` file to launch the 3-D digital moon globe WebApp.

3. Explore the moon's surface and visualize seismic events.

4. Additionally, you will find instructions for creating the physical moonquake simulator. This includes guidance on both the structural aspects and the electronic circuitry.
